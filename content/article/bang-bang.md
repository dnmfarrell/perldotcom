Interpreters reads and executes scripts (when shells are more like a kitchen pass-through and can either execute or hand over to another interpreter). When we specify interpreter on the command line, it is the one that will be used. For instance `Rscript script.R` will execute `script.R` using the `Rscript` interpreter.

When we execute a file without explicitly giving an interpreter (for instance, like `./myscript.pl`), it is the job of the "shebang" to tell to the shell/OS which interpreter to use. The shebang is that first line of a text file that starts with `#!` and is followed by the interpreter path:

```
#!/usr/bin/perl
```

Sometimes you see the `env` program, which finds the right path for the program:

```
#!/usr/bin/env perl
```


## Perl is nice

The `perl` is not like other interpretersâ€”its nice, even with challenges. `perl` inspects the shebang to check if it's really for it (and if not it hands your program over to another interpreter).

![](/images/bang-bang/nice.jpg)

For instance the file `i-am-python.pl` contains this :

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import os;
import time;

print "I'm a snake : " + os.environ["SHELL"] + " " + os.environ["_"];

# Keep it alive to have time to inspect with ps
while True:
    time.sleep(5)
```

Obviouly we don't care about the extension as it does not mean any kind of file association (although some systems let you associate it). So we have a `.pl` file and we execute it with `perl` but inside we have a `python` shebang and some python code. It's clearly not a valid Perl file.

If you don't believe me, check this with a quick syntax check `perl -c i-am-python.pl` that tells us it isn't valid Perl:

```
$ perl -c i-am-python.pl
syntax error at i-am-python.pl line 4, near "environ["
iampython.pl had compilation errors.
```

When we execute this file with perl, surprisingly, everything goes fine. How did that happen? `perl` is smart enough to give the script to `python`!

```
$ perl i-am-python.pl
I'm a snake : /bin/bash /usr/bin/perl
```

And if we want to check which interpreter really runs this script, we can look in the process table:

```bash
$ ps aux | grep "i-am-pytho[n].pl"
tduponc+  5647  0.0  0.0  33208  7024 pts/0    S    13:04   0:00 /usr/bin/python i-am-python.pl
```

Note that `i-am-pytho[n].pl` with the brackets, which puts the `n` in a character class. That's a nifty trick so `grep` finds the line with `python` but not the `grep` process itself because that pattern won't match a literal `[`.

Don't forget to kill the program since it's sleeping forever.


Now, what if we want to test the converse and run Perl code with a `python` interpreter?

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl

my $str = "I'm a jewel";
print "$str : $ENV{SHELL} $ENV{_}\n";

while (1) { sleep 5; }
```

This is a valid Perl file but the `python` interpreter does not hand over to `perl` and just returns a Python error:

```bash
$ python i-am-perl.py
  File "iamperl.py", line 3
    my $str = "I'm a jewel";
       ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

This is special to Python. Try it yourself with bash, Ruby, or something else.

## I have something for you

Having the correct interpreter on the command line does not mean that the shebang is totally ignored. `perl` is once again super smart and behaves exactly as we can imagine (DWIM). For instance, what if we put a warning switch (`-w`) in the shebang, like in this file `override-bang.pl` :

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

$str = "will produce a warning";
```

Even though we don't put the `-w` on the command line, we still get warnings;

```bash
$ perl override-bang.pl
Name "main::str" used only once: possible typo at override-bang.pl line 3.
```

## Plenty is no plague

Now, what if I specify some switches on the command line and some others in the shebang? **SPOILER**: they are simply merged together.

When we run `perl -c overridebang.pl` to check syntax (on a file where the syntax is ok), we get the switches from the command line and the shebang line. We get a `perl -cw` execution:

```bash
Name "main::str" used only once: possible typo at override-bang.pl line 5.
override-bang.pl syntax OK
```

### Life is a matter of choices

What if we have conflicting options like a shebang that disables warnings `#!/usr/bin/perl -X` and a command line with warning switch `perl -w disable-warnings.pl` ?

#### Shebang 1 - Command line 0

With a `disablewarnings.pl` file like this  :

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl -X

$str = "will produce a warning";
```

The shebang (`-X`) is taken in priority versus the command line and no warning is reported.
Same if we execute the file with `perl -W disablewarnings.pl`.

We could imagine that's a rule to resolve conflicts with "last seen" parameter but wait, it's not that simple.

#### Shebang 1 - 1 Command line

Let's try the contrary, with a file `enablewarnings.pl`:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

$str = "will produce a warning";
```

This time `perl -X enablewarnings.pl` does not produce any warning.

Then this time the command line was stronger than shebang.

#### Shebang 2 - 1 Command line

To confuse you (and me) a bit more, if we put `-W` (= "disable all warning") instead of `-w`, this time the shebang `-W` wins...

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl -W

$str = "will produce a warning";
```

This is what we get:
```bash
$ perl -X enableallwarnings.pl
Name "main::str" used only once: possible typo at enableallwarnings.pl line 3.
```

## Hashbang limitations

The hashbang implementations can have some limitations like the length of the hashbang line (16 or 32 chars in the very early versions of Linux kernel)

Some very old systems can also simply not recognize the shebang mechanism...

![Crying man](/images/bang-bang/cryingman.jpg)

Please note this important `#!/usr/bin/env` limitation for `perl` :

`env` does not split args therefore you **CAN'T WRITE** :

`#!/usr/bin/env perl -w`

Please also note that `env` is not always located in `/usr/bin/env` so it can garantee some portability at machine/distribution level but not always between distributions.

## Magic incantation

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
    if $running_under_some_shell;
```

What the hell is this black magic ?

![](/images/bang-bang/blackmagic.png)

This is actually very smart `perl` scripts openings...

Very smart because this code is **"polyglot"** means correct for both **shells** (with or without shebang support) AND **perl**.

(not totally true actually, `csh` seems to require a modified version for instance)

Let's look how it will be read and understood by shells/perl.

### Script started by perl

In this case, job is done and perl executes :
```perl
eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
if $running_under_some_shell;
```

(I removed shebang but `perl` actually interpreted it... for instance to pick up options, as we discussed earlier)

The code snippet above is actually the same than :
```perl
eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"} if 0;'
```

And this code just does nothing (`eval ... if 0;`) and just get ignored and the rest of the file is interpreted normally.

### Script started by a shell/OS that recognizes shebangs

The shell/OS recognizes the shebang and does the handover to `perl` that start reading the first line (shebang then `eval ...`)

The execution flow is then the same than above (magic incantation does nothing and file is interpreted).

### Script started by a shell/OS that does NOT recognize shebang

This is actually where this magic is useful.

The shell will ignore first line and will never reach third line.

Why "never reach third line" ?

Because in shell script the newline terminates the command (!) and exec will replace the current execution by `perl`.

In this case the following code :
```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
    if $running_under_some_shell;
```

is semantically the same than :

```perl
eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
```

With `$0` and `$@` being shell words for the script name and arguments
and `-S` option being `look for programfile using PATH environment variable` ([perldoc](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlrun.html#Command-Switches))

## Basic fun with perl -x

In this article we had fun with perl interpreter and shebang, but `perl` has a `-x` which is already fun *by design*.

This `-x` option tells Perl that the program to execute is actually embedded in a larger chunk of unrelated text to ignore.

### -x is fun

(pun based on [XS is fun](https://github.com/xsawyerx/xs-fun))


Just an example of what we can do with `perl -x`

```bash
"I do not know if it is what you want, but it is what you get.
        -- Larry Wall"

#!/usr/bin/env perl

print "perl -x ignores everything before shebang\n";
print <DATA>;

__END__

"Fortunately, it is easier to keep an old interpreter around than an
old computer.
        -- Larry Wall"
```

When we execute this code with `perl -x` :

```bash
perl -x ignores everything before shebang

"Fortunately, it is easier to keep an old interpreter around than an
old computer.
        -- Larry Wall"
```

Everything before shebang was ignored as everything in the `DATA` section (after `__END__`)
but I was able to retrieve and print `DATA` section with `<DATA>` (it is cool right?).

### perl -x-ception

If you are greedy and want to do some **"perl -x-ception"** then you will get an error.

For instance with this file called `minusx.pl` :

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl -x
#!/usr/bin/perl
```

The execution of :
```bash
$ ./minusx.pl
```

Will produce an error :
```
Can't emulate -x on #! line.
```

All good things come to an end... :D

But wait, maybe we have a chance if we combine with "magic incantation trick" we can do the **"perl -x-ception"** :

```perl
#!/bin/sh
eval 'if [ -x /opt/myperl/bin/perl ]; then exec /opt/myperl/bin/perl -x -- $0 ${1+"$@"}; else exec /usr/bin/perl -x $0 ${1+"$@"}; fi;'
  if 0;

#!/usr/bin/perl

print "$]\n";
```

This cool trick will execute my code with my own perl binary or fallback to vendor perl.

*Why does the "perl -x-ception" worked this time whereas it failed in the first attempt ?*

Because the `perl -x` is now executed in a shell process and not interpreted by perl binary like previously.

This is mad.

## startperl

We would not be complete about perl shebang without discussing a bit about the config variable `$Congig{startperl}`.

This variable comes from `Config.pm` which is an **heavy config** that provides information about configuration environment.

```bash
$ perl -e 'use Config; print $Config{startperl}'
#!/usr/bin/perl
```

It is actually built during compilation from defaults or user/vendor provided configs.

Then how to customize it ?

Simply choose the value of this during the `./Configure` step, the configure option is `-Dstartperl='...'`.

Look at the following line where I choose to set `startperl` to `/my/shebang` :

```bash
$ ./Configure -des -Dstartperl='#!/my/shebang'
```

It will change numerous (if not all...) shebang in tools around perl interpreter (like `prove` for instance).

Later when we use `perl` interpreter to read `$Config{startperl}`, we have well our **custom shebang** :

And the `$Config{startperl}` itself :

```bash
$ perl -e 'use Config; print $Config{startperl}'
#!/my/shebang
```

In addition, `ExtUtils::MakeMaker` and `Module::Build` seems also to use `startperl` among other methods to fix modules shebangs.

If you want to use this trick, take care of using a perl intepreter or a program that behaves like a perl interpreter (means : can handle or pass-through the same command line options).

Why exactly ? It is because some CPAN modules use `startperl` to write first line of generated perl tests and the `/usr/bin/env` limitation still apply here (they suppose it's a perl interpreter and that they can add switches...).

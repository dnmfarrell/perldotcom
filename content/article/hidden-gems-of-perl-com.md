A few months ago, as I was familiarizing myself with the old Perl.com source material, I kept getting distracted by these wonderful articles that I hadn't read before. Now that the site has relaunched, and the old articles lovingly restored, I thought I'd share a few of these hidden gems with you.

### Here be Wizards

*Where Wizards Fear to Tread* was a brief, perlguts-focused series started by [Simon Cozens](/authors/simon-cozens/). This particular [article]({{< relref "_pub_2002_05_07_optree.md" >}}) discusses the Perl op tree.

I'd love to rekindle this series. If you have a Perl internals article that you'd like to write, please get in touch with [me](mailto:perl.com-editor@perl.org) or see our contributing [guide](https://github.com/dnmfarrell/perldotcom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and send us a pull request with a draft article.

### Naughty Perl

In the old Perl.com source code, I came across several raw documents which didn't appear to have been officially published on the site, but did contain good content. For example [Tom Christiansen's](/authors/tom-christiansen/) article [The Seven Deadly Sins of Perl]({{< relref "_doc_FMTEYEWTK_versus_perl.md" >}}) is a fun read worthy of your time. Can you count how many of the "sins" have been addressed since then?

### Just code it in Perl (6)?

[Why not Translate Perl to C?]({{< relref "_pub_2001_06_27_ctoperl.md" >}}) is a sobering reminder by [Mark Jason Dominus](/authors/mark-jason-dominus/) that re-writing Perl as C often won't yield faster programs. The article ends with optimistic speculation that Perl 6 may use gradual typing and static data structures to deliver better performance. Fast-forward a few years, and good news! Perl 6 supports [sized and typed data structures](https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2015/12/18/day-18-sized-typed-shaped/).

MJD regularly blogs at his own [site](https://blog.plover.com/).

### State of the Onion

Larry has a good number of [articles](/authors/larry-wall/) on Perl.com, including some of the oldest. The [2nd State of the Onion]({{< relref "_pub_1998_08_show_onion.md" >}}) was published way back in August 1998, and it's still an entertaining read (or re-read if you've forgotten it).

### More to come

There are more articles to recommend, but for the sake of brevity I'll stop here. In the meantime feel free to explore the site; you never know, you might stumble upon another ... hidden gem!

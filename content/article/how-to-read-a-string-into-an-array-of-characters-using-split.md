Perl's split function has a useful feature that will split a string into characters. This works by supplying an empty regex pattern ("//") to the split function. This can be used to easily split a word into an array of letters, for example:

```perl
my $word = 'camel';
my @letters = split(//, $word);
```

Perl's official documentation has more on the split function. You can read it [online]({{< perlfunc "split" >}}) or by running the following command at the terminal:

```perl
perldoc -f split
```

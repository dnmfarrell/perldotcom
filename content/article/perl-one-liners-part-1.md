A shell (like Bash) provides built-in commands and scripting features to easily solve and automate various tasks. External commands like grep, sed, Awk, sort, find, or parallel can be combined to work with each other. Sometimes you can use Perl either as a single replacement or a complement to them for specific use cases.

Perl is the most robust portable option for text processing needs. Perl has a feature rich regular expression engine, built-in functions, an extensive ecosystem, and is quite portable. However, Perl may have slower performance compared to specialized tools and can be more verbose.

## One-liners or scripts?

For assembly-level testing of a digital signal processing (DSP) chip, I had to replicate the same scenario for multiple address ranges. My working knowledge of Linux command line was limited at that time and I didn't know how to use sed or Awk. I used Vim and Perl for all sorts of text processing needs.

I didn't know about Perl's options for one-liners, so I used to modify a script whenever I had to do search-and-replace for multiple files. Once, I even opened the files as Vim buffers and used `bufdo` to apply a command to all buffers to see if that would make my workflow simpler. If I had known about Perl one-liners, I could have easily combined find and Bash globs to make my life easier.

I can pass an argument to `-i` to create a backup of the original file. For example, `-i.bkp` will create *ip.txt.bkp* as the backup:

```bash
$ perl -i -pe 's/0xABCD;/0x1234;/; s/0xDEAD;/0xBEEF;/;' *.tests
```

I can also put the backups in another existing directory. The `*` gets expanded to original filename:

```bash
$ mkdir backups
$ perl -i'backups/*' -pe 's/SEARCH/REPLACE/g' *.txt
```

## Powerful regexp features

Perl regexps are much more powerful than either basic or extended regular expressions used by utilities. The common features I often use are non-greedy and possessive quantifiers, lookarounds, the `e` flag, subexpression calls, and `(*SKIP)(*FAIL)`. Here are some examples from StackOverflow threads that I have answered over the years.

### Skip some matches

This question needed [to convert avr-asm to arm-gnu comments](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64368280/sed-script-to-convert-avr-asm-to-arm-gnu-comments). The starting file looks like this:

```bash
ABC r1,';'
ABC r1,";" ; comment
  ;;;
```

I need to change `;` to `@`, but not change `;` within single or double quotes. I match those in the first branch of the alternation and use `(*SKIP)(*F)` to not replace those (I wish it had a shorter syntax, like `(*SF)`):

```
$ perl -pe 's/(?:\x27;\x27|";")(*SKIP)(*F)|;/@/' ip.txt
ABC r1,';'
ABC r1,";" @ comment
  @;;
```

### Replace a string with an incrementing value

I can [replace string with incrementing value](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42554684/shell-replace-string-with-incrementing-value). The `/e` on a substitution allows me to treat the replacement side as Perl code. Whatever that code evaluates to is the replacement. That can be a variable that I increment:

```bash
$ echo 'a | a | a | a | a | a | a | a' | perl -pe 's/ *\| */$i++/ge'
a0a1a2a3a4a5a6a
```

### Reverse a substring

I also used the `/e` trick [to reverse matched pattern](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63681983/sed-reverse-matched-pattern):

```
$ echo 'romarana:qwerty12543' | perl -pe 's/\d+$/reverse $&/e'
romarana:qwerty34521
```

### Do some arithmetic

Add another `/e` to get `/ee` means there are two rounds of Perl code. I evaluate the replacement side to get the string that I'll evaluate as Perl code. In [Arithmetic replacement in a text file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62241101/arithmetic-replacement-in-a-text-file), I need to find simple arithmetic, like `25100+10`, and replace that with its arithmetic result:

```
id=25100+10
xyz=1+
abc=123456
conf_string=LMN,J,IP,25100+1,0,3,1
```

I can do that with one `/e` by matching the numbers and doing some Perl on the replacement side:

```
$ perl -pe 's/(\d+)\+(\d+)/$1+$2/ge' ip.txt
id=25110
xyz=1+
abc=123456
conf_string=LMN,J,IP,25101,0,3,1
```

But instead of matching the number, I can match the whole expression. The match is in `$&`, so the first `/e` interpolates that to `25100+10`. The second round runs that as Perl, which is addition:

```
$ perl -pe 's/\d+\+\d+/$&/gee' ip.txt
id=25110
xyz=1+
abc=123456
conf_string=LMN,J,IP,25101,0,3,1
```

## Handling the newline

Here's how you can perform multi-line fixed string substitution with `perl`. Don't save contents of *search.txt* and *replace.txt* in shell variablesâ€”trailing newlines and ASCII NUL characters will cause issues. I want to un-hypenate this text:

```bash
Hello there.
It will rain to-
day. Have a safe
and pleasant jou-
rney.
```

In Awk this is easy. Set the record separator `RS` to nothing, then make all the substitutions on one big string:

```bash
$ awk 'BEGIN {RS=""}{gsub(/-\n/,"",$0); print $0}' test.txt
Hello there.
It will rain today. Have a safe
and pleasant journey.
```

In Perl, `-0777` does the same thing:

```
$ perl -pe 's/-\n//' msg.txt
Hello there.
It will rain today. Have a safe
and pleasant journey.
```

#######################

```bash
perl -0777 -ne '$#ARGV==1 ? $s=$_ : $#ARGV==0 ? $r=$_ :
                print s/\Q$s/$r/gr' search.txt replace.txt ip.txt
```

Unlike grep, sed, or Awk, Perl doesn't remove the input record by default, so the last item has the newline. I have this

## Better regex support

Some other regex libraries have problems tied to whatever they use to implement them. GNU verions, for example, may have some bugs that other implementations may not have. Which version you use can give different results. Perl, however, has the same bugs everywhere.

### Back references

There's a [problem with backreferences in glibc](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25322) that I found and [reported for grep](https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=26864). This bug is seen in at least GNU implementations of grep and sed. As far as I know, no implementation of Awk supports backreferences within regexp definition.

I wanted to get words having two occurrences of repeated characters.
This example takes some time and results in no output:

```bash
$ grep -m2 -xiE '([a-z]*([a-z])\2[a-z]*){2}' /usr/share/dict/words
```

It does work when nesting is unrolled or PCRE is used:

```bash
$ grep -m2 -xiE '[a-z]*([a-z])\1[a-z]*([a-z])\2[a-z]*' /usr/share/dict/words
Abbott
Annabelle
...
$ grep -m2 -xiP '([a-z]*([a-z])\2[a-z]*){2}' /usr/share/dict/words
Abbott
Annabelle
...
```

Here's the Perl, which is the original regex:

```bash
$ perl -ne 'print if /([a-z]*([a-z])\2[a-z]*){2}/' /usr/share/dict/words
Abbott
Annabelle
...
```

### Word boundaries

[Why doesn't this sed command replace the 3rd-to-last "and"?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/579889/why-doesnt-this-sed-command-replace-the-3rd-to-last-and) shows another interesting bug when word boundaries and group repetition are involved. This bug is seen in anything using the regex stuff from glibc (as you would on Linux):

This incorrectly matches because there is no word boundary in the middle of "cocoa":

```bash
$ sed --version
sed (GNU sed) 4.4
$ echo 'cocoa' | sed -nE '/(\bco){2}/p'
cocoa
```

Without the quantifier, there's no problem and no matches:

```bash
$ echo 'cocoa' | sed -nE '/\bco\bco/p'
$ echo 'cocoa' | perl -ne 'print if /(\bco){2}/'
```

On the sed on macOS (which doesn't have a `--version`), there's no output, which is correct and different:

```bash
$ echo 'cocoa' | sed -nE '/(\bco){2}/p'
```

This means that again you can't rely on sed across platforms.

Here's another example from Gnu sed. This modifies the line because it thinks it finds "it" as a separate word two times, but the second is really in the middle of "sit":

```bash
$ echo 'it line with it here sit too' | sed -E 's/with(.*\bit\b){2}/XYZ/'
it line XYZ too
```

Change the pattern to get rid of the quantifier and it works correctly:

```
$ echo 'it line with it here sit too' | sed -E 's/with.*\bit\b.*\bit\b/XYZ/'
it line with it here sit too
$ echo 'it line with it here sit too' | perl -pe 's/with(.*\bit\b){2}/XYZ/'
it line with it here sit too
```

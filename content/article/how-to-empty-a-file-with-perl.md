Have you ever had the experience of doing something a certain way for a long time, and then you discover a better way? This happened to me last week, when I was working on some code that needed to empty a file. Emptying a file is a common operation - maybe you have a session log file to write to, or want to limit disk space use, or whatever. Here's how I usually do it:

```perl
# empty the file
{ open my $session_file, '>', 'path/to/sessionfile' }
```

This opens a write filehandle on the file, effectively setting its length to zero. I put the call to [open]({{< perlfunc "open" >}}) between curly braces in order to minimize the scope of the filehandle, `$session_file`. After that statement, the block closes, and `$session_file` variable goes out of scope, automatically closing the filehandle. As the block looks a little strange, I include an explanatory comment.

The other day though, I came across the [truncate]({{< perlfunc "truncate" >}}) function. This does exactly what you'd think it does: truncates files. It takes two arguments: the file path (or filehandle), and the length. So if you need to truncate a file, you can do:

```perl
truncate 'path/to/sessionfile', 0;
```

This doesn't use a lexical variable, so no scoping is required. It's unambiguous so no comment is needed either. I like it, it's a better way.

N.B. on Windows `truncate` requires the file to not be open elsewhere on the system, and if called with a filehandle it must be in append mode.

### Looking up Perl functions

Do you know Perl has around 220 built in functions? You can read about them all in [perlfunc]({{< perldoc "perlfunc" >}}), or at the terminal with `perldoc perlfunc`. Read more about the [truncate]({{< perlfunc "truncate" >}}) function at the terminal with `perldoc -f truncate`.

**Vim users** if you're editing Perl code and want to lookup a function, place the cursor on the function word and type `Shift-k` to lookup the function in perldoc (works for Python, Ruby, C etc too).

[Todd Rinaldo](https://metacpan.org/author/TODDR) has uploaded Larry's State of the Onion talk from YAPC ~~19100~~ 2000 to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1SEt_-QMDo). Previously it was available in separate mp3 files, but this is much more accessible.

It's a typical Larry talk filled with quirky, humorous observations about life and programming, and notably he announces the Perl 6 project.

Unfortunately the audio is low quality (hey it was 20 years ago at a low-budget conference); you can read a transcript of the talk [here]({{< relref "_pub_2000_10_23_soto2000.md" >}}) (with mp3 download links at the bottom). We also have collection of attendees' [reports]({{< relref "_pub_2000_07_yapc19101.md" >}}) from the conference.

If you enjoy Larry's talks, you might like some of his other [transcribed talks / articles](/authors/larry-wall/).

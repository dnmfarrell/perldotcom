"Big data" is an overused term, but when you're actually working with big data, every bit can count. Shaving several bits from data structure used billions of times can save a lot of space. A few months ago I was working on a job distribution system; it would send millions of jobs out every day. We wanted to capture every decision made by the system, so that a user could later query the system to understand _why_ a job had or hadn't been sent to a partner.

The problem was that the system was making billions of decisions a day, so we needed a way to pack those decisions as efficiently as possible. A colleague of mine had the bright idea to use a [bit array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array), and it worked very well - we were able to compress the data by a factor of 18 or more. If you're not familiar with bit arrays, or a little rusty on the code, keep reading and I'll show you how to use them with Perl.

### Bit array basics

Bit arrays are a way of storing multiple booleans in single number. Consider the number 0 as a byte/octet represented as bits:

    00000000

Instead of treating it like a number, using [bitwise operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation) we can treat each bit as a separate column. As this is an 8 bit number, we can store up to 8 booleans in it:

    0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

To store a boolean in the first bit of the array, we can use bitwise or equals (`|=`). Here's how that looks in C pseudocode:

```perl
short bit_array = 0;
bit_array |= 1 << 6;
```

Let's take this one step at a time. First I initialize an 8 bit integer called `bit_array`. Next, I create a binary number with the bit set that I wish to set in `bit_array`. I do this with the left bitshift code `1 << 6`. This means, "shift the bits in the number on the left, 6 places to the left", which does this:

    00000001 << 6;
    01000000

This is called a bitmask. Next I use or equals to update `bit_array` with the bitmask `01000000`. Bitwise or (`|`) works by setting any bit to 1 in its left operand that is set to 1 in its right operand. Adding a equals sign on the end simply assigns the resulting value to `bit_array`.

If we wanted to store a boolean in the fourth bit, we'd do this:

```perl
bit_array |= 1 << 3;
```

So now the `bit_array` looks like this:

    01001000

To test if a particular bit is set, I can use bitwise and (`&`):

```perl
if (bit_array & (1 << 6)) {
  /* the seventh column is true */
}
```

Bitwise and returns a number with every bit set to 0 in its left operand which is 0 in its right operand. So the code `1 << 6` bitshifts a number that only has one particular bit set to 1 (`01000000`). This is the bitmask. If the bit array has that bit set to 1, it will return non-zero (true), else it returns zero (false).

### Bit arrays in Perl

I'm going to use a contrived example to show how bit arrays work in Perl. Imagine we're working on an ordering system at a pizza restaurant. We need to store all the toppings required for the pizza. In Perl we store numbers in scalars, which are usually 32 or 64 bits long; that's a lot of toppings we can pack into a single number!

Here is the class:

```perl
package Pizza::Order;
use utf8;

my %toppings = (
  tomato        => 1 << 0,
  cheese        => 1 << 1,
  onion         => 1 << 2,
  sausage       => 1 << 3,
  pepperoni     => 1 << 4,
  ham           => 1 << 5,
  chicken       => 1 << 6,
  bbq_chicken   => 1 << 7,
  olives        => 1 << 8,
  vegetables    => 1 << 9,
  jalapeńo      => 1 << 10,
  ranch         => 1 << 11,
  eggplant      => 1 << 12,
  garlic        => 1 << 13,
);

sub new {
  my $class = shift;
  my $self = 0;
  return bless \$self, $class;
}

sub print_state {
  my $self = shift;
  printf "%014b\n", $$self;
}

sub available_toppings {
  return keys %toppings;
}

sub add_topping {
  my ($self, $topping) = @_;
  # bitwise OR equals to set a bit field
  return $$self |= $toppings{ $topping };
}

sub remove_topping {
  my ($self, $topping) = @_;
  # bitwise NOT to invert a field and bitwise AND equals to unset it
  return $$self &= ~$toppings{ $topping };
}

sub get_toppings {
  my $self = shift;
  my @ordered_toppings = ();
  for my $topping (keys %toppings) {
    push @ordered_toppings, $topping
      # bitwise AND to test if this bit is set
      if $$self & $toppings{ $topping };
  }
  return @ordered_toppings;
}
1;
```

I create a class called `Pizza::Order`. The `%toppings` hash stores names of pizza toppings and their associated bitmask. I could only think of 14 toppings, leaving 18 spare slots for the future (if we want to stick to 32 bit integers). The `new` subroutine is a constructor which creates a blessed scalar as the `Pizza::Order` object.

The `print_state` method uses [printf]({{< perlfunc "printf" >}}) to print the Pizza::Order object state as a binary number. This is a really useful feature of `printf` which many other languages don't have (C & Python for example). Both `add_topping` and `get_toppings` use the techniques described earlier to set and check for set bits.

More interesting perhaps, is the `remove_topping` method. This uses bitwise not (`~`) to invert a bitmask and then bitwise and (`&`) equals to unset it. Pretty nifty, huh? Here's a quick script to test it:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
use Pizza::Order;

my $order = Pizza::Order->new();
$order->add_topping('cheese');
$order->add_topping('eggplant');
$order->remove_topping('cheese');
$order->add_topping('tomato');
$order->print_state();
print "$_\n" for $order->get_toppings();
```

This prints:

```perl
01000000000001
eggplant
tomato
```

The first line is the current state of the `$order` object. It shows the first, and second-to-last bits set, which correspond to the tomato and eggplant bitmasks. It then prints out those toppings. Yay, it works!

### Bit array limitations

One thing to watch out for when storing bit arrays on disk is code change. Imagine if I had several years' worth of pizza orders saved in a database. Then one day, we stopped offering bbq chicken. It would be tempting to update the toppings hash like this:

```perl
my %toppings = (
  tomato        => 1 << 0,
  cheese        => 1 << 1,
  onion         => 1 << 2,
  sausage       => 1 << 3,
  pepperoni     => 1 << 4,
  ham           => 1 << 5,
  chicken       => 1 << 6,
  olives        => 1 << 7, # deleted bbq_chicken
  vegetables    => 1 << 8,
  jalapeńo      => 1 << 9,
  ranch         => 1 << 10,
  eggplant      => 1 << 11,
  garlic        => 1 << 12,
);
```

I deleted the `bbq_chicken` entry and bumped up the remaining toppings bitmasks. The problem is compatibility: in all the historical pizza orders, `olives` (for example) had a bitmask of `00000010000000` but in the new code, its bitmask is one lower. So if I tried to load a historical order with this class, the toppings data would be wrong. One way to handle this is remove, but not reuse, the bitmask for the deleted entry.

```perl
my %toppings = (
  tomato        => 1 << 0,
  cheese        => 1 << 1,
  onion         => 1 << 2,
  sausage       => 1 << 3,
  pepperoni     => 1 << 4,
  ham           => 1 << 5,
  chicken       => 1 << 6,
  # reserved
  olives        => 1 << 8,
  vegetables    => 1 << 9,
  jalapeńo      => 1 << 10,
  ranch         => 1 << 11,
  eggplant      => 1 << 12,
  garlic        => 1 << 13,
);
```

This limitation makes bitmasks less useful for long-term storage of data, unless the existing bitmasks are unlikely to change. Note that it's fine to add additional toppings and bitmasks, it's just re-using existing bitmasks that causes issues.

Another thing to consider is upper limits (update - see [using bit arrays with large integers](http://perltricks.com/article/using-bitmasks-with-large-integers/)). If you want your Perl code to be compatible with 32 bit and 64 bit Perls, you should probably stick to a maximum of 32 bitmasks (using a module like [bigint]({{<mcpan "bigint" >}}) may *not* work because of addressable memory limitations). You can see the settings your Perl has been compiled with by typing `perl -V | grep longsize` at the command line. The longsize value is the number of bytes your Perl can store in an integer natively.

Finally, in order to get the data back out of a bit array it needs to be tested with all the available bitmasks. Consider the `get_toppings` method in `Pizza::Order`. To find out what toppings are set, the code has to check every topping's bitmask. This is pretty inefficient. So bitmasks are good for compact data storage, but not fast access.

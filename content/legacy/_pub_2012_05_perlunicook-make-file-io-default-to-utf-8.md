℞ 17: Make ﬁle I/O default to utf8
----------------------------------

If you've ever had the misfortune of seeing the Unicode warning "wide character in print", you may have realized that something forgot to set the appropriate Unicode-capable encoding on a filehandle somewhere in your program. Remember that the rule of Unicode handling in Perl is "always encode and decode at the edges of your program".

You can easily [Decode `STDIN`, STDOUT, and `STDERR` as UTF-8 by default](/pub/2012/04/perlunicook-decode-standard-filehandles-as-utf-8.html) or [Decode `STDIN`, STDOUT, and `STDERR` per local settings](/pub/2012/04/perlunicook-decode-standard-filehandles-as-locale-encoding.html) as a default, or you can use [`binmode`]({{< perlfunc "binmode" >}}) to set the encoding on a specific filehandle.

Alternately, you can set the default encoding on all filehandles through the entire program, or on a lexical basis. As documented in [perldoc perlrun]({{< perldoc "perlrun" >}}), the `-C` flag and the `PERL_UNICODE` environment variable are available. Use the `D` option to make all filehandles default to UTF-8 encoding. That is, files opened without an encoding argument will be in UTF-8:

         $ perl -CD ...
         # or
         $ export PERL_UNICODE=D

The [open]({{< perldoc "open" >}}) pragma configures the default encoding of all filehandle operations in its lexical scope:

         use open qw(:utf8);

Note that the `open` pragma is currently incompatible with the [`autodie`]({{< perldoc "autodie" >}}) pragma.

℞ 43: Unicode text in DBM hashes, the easy way
----------------------------------------------

[Some Perl libraries require you to jump through hoops to handle Unicode data](/pub/2012/06/perlunicook-unicode-text-in-stubborn-libraries.html). Would that everything worked as easily as Perl's [open]({{< perldoc "open" >}}) pragma!

For DBM files, here's how to implicitly manage the translation; all encoding and decoding is done automatically, just as with streams that have a particular encoding attached to them. The [DBM\_Filter]({{<mcpan "DBM_Filter" >}}) module allows you to apply filters to keys and values to manipulate their contents before storing or fetching. The module includes a "utf8" filter. Use it like:

        use DB_File;
        use DBM_Filter;

        my $dbobj = tie %dbhash, "DB_File", "pathname";
        $dbobj->Filter_Value_Push("utf8");  # this is the magic bit

     # ST

        # assume $uni_key and $uni_value are abstract Unicode strings
        $dbhash{$uni_key} = $uni_value;

      # FETCH

        # $uni_key holds a normal Perl string (abstract Unicode)
        my $uni_value = $dbhash{$uni_key};
